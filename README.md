# knee_state_classification


 
this project is made from collecting knee digital xrays dateset to classify the state of the knee whether its normal state knee , doubtful state knee , mild state knee ,moderate state knee and severe state knee .

-The initialization of the project starts by downloading the dataset digital knee xrays from mendeley which is available throughout this link : https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/t9ndx37v5h/1.

-After exploring dataset we found that the dataset contains 5 main classes for knee state classification those 5 classes are : normal knee state , Doubtful , mild ,Moderate and severe knee classes

-Fortunately the image data is cleaned it just needs resizing to size 224x224 in order to be used in more advanced CNNs such as VGG16 , MobileNet ... so on .

-After Model training we need to save the model in Model saved format to be used later in deployment scenarios



-Some screenshots for the output results
